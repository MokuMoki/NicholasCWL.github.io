		<h1 class="h1">Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>
		This guide provides basic tips &amp; tricks of professional LoL players to prevent you from becoming a food &lpar;feeding&rpar; and also able to catch opponents unattended as well.
		<br/><br/>
		<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: gold;">1. Stay behind your minions</span>
		<br/><br/>
		<img src="assets/games/lol/minions.jpg" style="width: 60%;"/>
		<br/><br/>
		This is the most powerful tips of protecting yourself. Minions are meant to act as your shield to cushion you from incoming damage because we don't want ourselves to get injured 
		before fighting the enemy champions or else enemy will have the upper hand in this situation and there is a high chance of getting slain by other enemy champions if you are in low health.
		This tips is especially useful for <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">&quot;squishy&quot;</span> champions as enemies will try to hunt squishy champion down first because squishy champions can be easily taken down.
		Another reason is also because some squishy champions have a high damage output which is very troublesome to deal with. Moving on, staying behind your minions can also block some of the champions' 
		special ability which can sometimes prevent you from getting burst damage from other enemy champion.
		<br/><br/>
		<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: gold;">2. Always stay out of range of turrets</span>
		<br/><br/>
		<img src="assets/games/lol/turrets.jpg" style="width: 60%;"/>
		<br/><br/>
		It is not advisable for anyone to obliterate the turret alone without your own minions defending the turret's attack because a turret's attack can be very taxing when trying to tank it 
		especially during low level unless you are really <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:bold;">&quot;FAT&quot;</span> and tanky in the game or the tower has low health. 
		Otherwise, you might get killed by a turret like a noob which will get you kick out of the club. A viable solution to this would be following the first tips which is staying behind your minion as 
		they can divert the aim of enemy turrets so that you can take the opportunity to destroy the turret in the meantime.
		<br/><br/>
		<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; font-size: 22px;">Note:</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Stay alert to your minions' health and leave the enemy turret's area when all of your minion are almost wiped out as you don't want to be left stranded in the enemy turret's area.</span>
		<br/><br/>
		<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: gold;">3. Stay hidden inside a brush to ambush your opponent</span>
		<br/><br/>
		<img src="assets/games/lol/brush.jpg" style="width: 60%;"/>
		<br/><br/>
		Hiding inside a brush while waiting a nearby enemy to approach is a smart way of ambushing an opponent. Hiding inside a brush will completely hide your presence from the outside so that you can catch your opponent unattended.
		However, this technique can be easily countered by wards. Ward allow players to reveal the hidden areas of the map including brushes. So, make sure you stay alert on the minimap as there might be patterns 
		of enemy movement coming in your way which possibly means they already discover your location and are ready to gank you. It is also usable in cases such that when you are trying to gank a lane, you can hide inside a brush to 
		stay low and wait for the precise timing to come out from the brush and gank your enemies with your teammates.
